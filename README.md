# ObjectOrientedProgramming


Object Oriented Programming is a computer programming model that organises software design around data, specifically objects, rather than functions and logic.

# 4 Key Concepts
<h2> How do you decrease function parameters to keep code neat and tidy? </h2>
**Encapsulation**
Creating objects that contain a Method and Property.

<h2> Now I have too many methods and properties, how can I hide them? </h2>
**Abstraction**
Hide most functions & parameters, leave only general ones.
Results in a simpler interface, and reduces impact of any changes.

<h2> I have too many objects with too many common properties & functions, what now? </h2>
**Inheritance**
Create a generic object aka base class, and get derived classes to inherit from it.

<h2> How do I get rid of nasty if...else...switch...case... statements? </h2>
**Polymorphism**
Create a general method that can hold many "forms".
The type of caller object chooses what kind of form to execute.
