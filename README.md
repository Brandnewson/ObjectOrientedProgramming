# ObjectOrientedProgramming

Object Oriented Programming is a computer programming model that organises software design around data, specifically objects, rather than functions and logic.

# 4 Key Concepts
### How do you decrease function parameters to keep code neat and tidy?
**Encapsulation**
- Creating objects that contain a Method and Property.

### Now I have too many methods and properties, how can I hide them?
**Abstraction**
- Hide most functions & parameters, leave only general ones.
- Results in a simpler interface, and reduces impact of any changes.

### I have too many objects with too many common properties & functions, what now? ###
**Inheritance**
- Create a generic object aka base class, and get derived classes to inherit from it.

### How do I get rid of nasty if...else...switch...case... statements? ###
**Polymorphism**
- Create a general method that can hold many "forms".
- The type of caller object chooses what kind of form to execute.
